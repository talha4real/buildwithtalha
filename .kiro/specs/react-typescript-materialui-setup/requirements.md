# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up a complete React TypeScript project with Material-UI (MUI) integration, including all necessary development tools, build configuration, and project structure to enable efficient development of modern web applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured React TypeScript project, so that I can build type-safe React applications with modern tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a React application with TypeScript support
2. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript code without errors
3. WHEN the development server starts THEN the system SHALL serve the application on localhost with hot reload functionality
4. IF TypeScript files contain type errors THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages during development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Material-UI components integrated into my React project, so that I can use pre-built UI components with consistent design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Material-UI is installed THEN the system SHALL include all necessary MUI packages and dependencies
2. WHEN MUI components are imported THEN the system SHALL resolve them without module errors
3. WHEN the application renders THEN the system SHALL apply MUI's default theme and styling
4. WHEN custom themes are defined THEN the system SHALL allow theme customization through MUI's theming system

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want essential development tools configured, so that I can maintain code quality and productivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL provide ESLint configuration for code quality checks
2. WHEN code is formatted THEN the system SHALL use Prettier for consistent code formatting
3. WHEN Git commits are made THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit hooks for code validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper project structure, so that I can organize code efficiently and follow best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL establish a clear folder structure for components, pages, and utilities
2. WHEN new files are added THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN imports are used THEN the system SHALL support absolute imports for better code organization
4. WHEN the project grows THEN the system SHALL maintain scalable architecture patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React Router integrated for navigation, so that I can create a multi-page application with client-side routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN React Router is installed THEN the system SHALL include react-router-dom package
2. WHEN routes are defined THEN the system SHALL support nested routing and route parameters
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL update the URL without page refresh
4. WHEN invalid routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL display a 404 page

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build and deployment configuration, so that I can create production-ready applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size and performance
2. WHEN assets are processed THEN the system SHALL handle static files, images, and fonts correctly
3. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL support different configurations for development and production
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate deployable static files
